    <h1>Welcome to my about page</h1>
    <p>Hi üëãüèæ,</p>
    <p>
      I am a knowledge weaver, I love connecting people to information and knowledge they want via computer systems. By using my skills as a software engineer I build systems that make it easy for people to discover information and gain knowledge from data they own.

    <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Full Stack web engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in web development using Python(Django) and JavaScript(Express and Svelte). 
    </p>
    <h2>Technical Writer</h2>
    <p>
      I love sharing my experience and learning with others. This is usually in the form of blog posts <a href="/">on my blog.</a> Writing gives me a platform to connect and share what I learn as I deepen my knowledge in topics that I find interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to mentor people interested in becoming Software Engineers. This mostly giving guidance, tips and encouragement to people taking their first steps in coding or programming. If you are looking for a mentor, feel free to get in touch with me.
